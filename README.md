# Experience technologies project site

**Version 1.0.0**

This is a readme file for my Experience technologies project site at Motionwares Academy. I used flexbox display property to build a landing page for a client(Experience tecnologies) that trains young people on tech-skills like web design, UI/UX design, digital marketing and machine learning.

Here are the objectives of this project
* To apply some topics learnt in HTML and CSS3.
* Avenue for prospective employers to assess my skill-set.
* To measure my growth and get feedback from the tech-community.

Link to the sample website used to build this project is found below.
